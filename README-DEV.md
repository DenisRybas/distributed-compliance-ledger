# Development Guideline

Please note, that the only officially supported platform now is Linux.
It's recommended to develop and deploy the App on Ubuntu 18.04 or Ubuntu 20.04.

## Pre-requisites
1. Install Go as described at https://golang.org/doc/install
    - Ensure that the following line has been appended to `/etc/profile`:
        ```
        export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
        ```
    - Ensure that the following line has been appended to `~/.profile`:
        ```
        export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
        ```
2. Install Docker as described at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
    - In `Installation methods` section follow `Install using the repository` method
    - Check whether your user of Ubuntu has been added to `docker` group using the following command:
        ```
        getent group docker | awk -F: '{print $4}'
        ```
        - If it has not been added, add it using `Manage Docker as a non-root user` section from https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/
 3. Install Docker Compose as described at https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

## Build and test

1. Building
    ```
    make build
    make install
    ```


2. Run unit tests
    ```
    make test
    ```

3. Run integration tests.

    The integration tests are run against a local pool of nodes in Docker.
    REST integration tests need to have a backend running (CLI in REST mode).

    The following script will start all necessary things and run the tests:
    ```
    ./integration_tests/ci/run-all.sh
    ```


## Run local pool
The easiest way to run a local pool is to start it in Docker:

    make install
    make localnet_init
    make localnet_start

This will start a local pool of 4 validator nodes in Docker. The nodes will expose their RPC enpoints on ports `26657`, `26659`, `26661`, `26662` correspondingly.

 Stopping the network: 

    make localnet_stop

 Then you can start the network again with the existing data using `make localnet_start`

If you need to start a new clean network then do the following steps prior to executing `make localnet_start`:
  - Remove `.dclcli` and `.dcld` directories from your user home directory (`~`)
  - Remove `localnet` directory from the root directory of the cloned project
  - Initialize the new network data using `make localnet_init` 
## Run CLI
Start a local pool as described above, and then just execute
```
dclcli
```
Have a look at [How To](docs/how-to.md) and [CLI Help](docs/cli-help.md) for instructions how to configure and use the CLI.

## Contributing
Please take into account the following when sending a PR:
1) Make sure there is a license header added:
    - Have a look at `make license` and `make license-check` command in [Makefile](Makefile).

2) Make sure the new functionality has unit tests added

3) Make sure the new functionality has integration tests added
    - [CLI-based tests](integration_tests/cli)
    - [REST-based tests](integration_tests/rest)

4) There is CI based on GitHub Actions that will do the following for every Pull Request:
    - make sure the app can be built
    - run go linter
    - run unit tests
    - run integratioins test
    - make sure there is a license header in all the files

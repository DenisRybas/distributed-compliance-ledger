## Dev environment

You will want nginx to add 'allow cross origin' headers to `dclcli` responses. Find nginx configuration template in `templates` and place it into `/etc/nginx/conf.d`.

## Deployment

- Read more about deployment in `ansible/README.md`.

## Configuration

Configuration is located in: `src/environments/environment.tx` and `src/environments/environment.prod.tx` for dev and prod environments correspondingly.
There are two important settings here:

- `apiUrl`: base path of the running `dclcli rest-server`;
- `chainId`: chain id, `dclchain` by default.
